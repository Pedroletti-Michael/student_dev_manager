# Student Dev Manager

This repo will contain the code of the manager that I will be using for managing the student during their dev intership.

I want to have different kind of action possible in this manager.

First of all we will have two side.
1. Student
2. "Admin"


The student will have acces to this plateform to :
1. list of the project that he need to do
2. list of the project that he have already realised
3. the possibility to switch the project to the status "correction needed"
4. the possibility to start a new project
5. have access to some basic starter information to start a project correctly

The student will need to give a link to a github to "send" the project to the "correction needed" status.
Like that, the student will learn how to use GitHub in addition to learn some basics of programmation.


For the "admin" part :
1. list of the project (all projects available)
2. possibility to modify them
3. list of the project started by the students (writed in this format "project_name / name of the student")
4. list of students.
5. list of project that need to be corrected (same format as the list of project started by ...)
6. possibility to have a detail of what an student already have do
7. choose the project that a student will do, specificly for one student at the time. Like that I will have the possibility to adapt in function of the level of the sudent and the motivation of the student



I will challenge myself and make this manager in laravel. Lika that I will have the possibility to learn new things and to apply all the new things that I will learn.



For my first step I will have to do :
1. Creation of the "homepage" for the user and the admin
2. Creation of the project detail, for the user and the admin
3. Creation of the student detail for the admin

For these I want an simple graphics interface. I don't want anything too fancy, I just want it to be easy to use and easy to do some modification on it.
### For my first step, I fix the ending point to 14th of november 2022.



After that I will add my exceptation for the step 2.
